# 	      File: fuzzyDuck.sh
#
#      version: 0.4
#
# 	     About: A shell script that is used to fuzz on an iOS device. 
#               Creates a webserver to serve up test cases that are 
#               created via zzuf and then uses sbopenurl to try and
#               launch the test case. If a crash is found it is saved
#               to crashes directory for further inspection. Quack.
#
#     pre-reqs: 1. Jailbreak iDevice
#               2. Install APT 0.7 Strict from cydia
#               3. Install OpenSSH from Cydia. 
#               4. Close Cydia on device.
#               5. Logon to device and change ssh root password from alpine (type passwd) at prompt!
#				6. Make a directory in /var/root called fuzzyDuck (e.g mkdir /var/root/fuzzyDuck )
#               7. SCP this script to directory on device you just created
#               8. Type chmod +x fuzzyDuck.sh to make executeable
#               9. run (see example)
#
#      Usage:   ./fuzzyDuck.sh <filename> <url> <port> <sleep>
#               ./fuzzyDuck.sh fuzzThis.mov http://localhost 3000 15  <- Standard Usage
# 				./fuzzyDuck cleanUp <- Deletes all directories
#  				./fuzzyDuck installUpD0g <- Installs upD0g launch Daemon to run after reboot / panic
#				./fuzzyDuck removeUpD0g <- Removes upD0g launch Daemon
#
# Arguments
